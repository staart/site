While many of us will be able to comfortably sustain for months at home, there will be millions of people—especially those with limited financial means, senior citizens, the differently abled, etc.—who may find it very difficult to pull through even for a few days without the basic three meals or essential medicines.

While the Government is putting significant effort into making the lives of its citizens comfortable, what can we do to help? **Karuna 2020** is a small effort to try to bring together people and do our part in helping feed those most affected during the coronavirus pandemic.

Our goal is to feed 10,000 families for a month in Delhi–NCR. We urge you to do your part—[contribute generously](/donate/) and [volunteer your time](/volunteers/).
